# Deep_learning_Paper_implementations
Deep Learning model implementations with Pytorch.

WITH INTENSIVE CODE ANNOTATIONS !!!!  (My understanding of the code)



Currently have:

  ResNet : Used CIFAR10 dataset for training (M2 Macbook Air)

  Transformer : Reduced architecture / hyperparam for M2 Macbook Air

  Deep Q-Network (DQN) : Used CartPole-v1, with no convolution layers(because of the CarPole state)

  AutoEncdoer : Used CIFAR10
