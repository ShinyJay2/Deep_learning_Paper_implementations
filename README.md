Each model comes with **intensive code annotations** to share insights into the architecture, training tricks, and reasoning behind design choices. Dive in to learn, adapt, and experiment!

### Models Implemented:

- **ResNet** 🖼️  
  - **Dataset**: CIFAR-10  
  - Leveraging ResNet to tackle image classification, with optimizations for running on the M2 MacBook Air.

- **Transformer** 🔄  
  - **Architecture**: Simplified, with reduced parameters  
  - Designed to fit the M2 MacBook Air’s performance, this reduced Transformer model retains the essence of the architecture without overwhelming your device.

- **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** 🎢  
  - **Environment**: CartPole-v1  
  - Implements DQN for CartPole, avoiding convolutional layers (ideal for CartPole’s simple state space) to keep things lean and efficient.

- **AutoEncoder** 🧩  
  - **Dataset**: CIFAR-10  
  - Trains an AutoEncoder for image reconstruction, showcasing a robust dimensionality reduction model on CIFAR-10.

- **Variational AutoEncoder (VAE)** 🔍  
  - **Dataset**: MNIST  
  - A compact VAE designed for the MNIST dataset, making it accessible for experimenting with generative modeling techniques.

- **RepVGG** 🔥  
  - **Dataset**: CIFAR-100  
  - Adapted for CIFAR-100 with reduced depth, lower width multipliers, and enhanced training techniques like AutoAugment, label smoothing, and mixup, achieving around **74% accuracy**.
